# The C# Airport Challenge

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

Still working on this, getting to grips with everything, but if you'd like to have a look at what I have so far, here's how to **get started!**

1. Clone the repo

2. Open the `AirportChallenge.sln` file in Visual Studio.

You can run the tests by opening the Unit Tests sidebar and clicking on the green button at the top.
